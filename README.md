# Bioremediation of a Coastal Oil Spill: A Case Study Using a Community Genome-Scale Metabolic Model

<img src="imgs/banner.png" alt="Banner image depicting bioremediation" style="width:100%; max-height:200px;">

This repo contains the supplementary Jupyter Notebook of the [perspective article](): Applications of marine microbial community models in the nature-based economy. In this notebook, we demonstrate the use of a community genome-scale metabolic model (cGEM) to simulate the bioremediation of a coastal oil spill. 


## Running the notebook locally

1) Clone this repository to your local machine, set up a virtual environment, and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone
cd
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2) Start a Jupyter Notebook server:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3) Open the notebook `oil_spill.ipynb` and run the cells.
